            <hr>
            <p>Librebook is a free online social media made by therandomspoon.</p>
            <p>The idea of Librebook was to give users a platform to communicate where any data is sold off to companies, because it just makes sense.</p>
            <p>Why use Librebook instead of any other popular socialmedia? - Because Librebook believes in not selling off data and letting users speak freely</p>
            <p>Isnt this kinda like facebook? "Look, a guy who builds a nice chair doesn's owe money to everyone who ever built a chair, okay? They came to me with an idea, I had a better one." - Mark Zuckerberg in the social network</p>
            <p>In other words no. I understand the looks are pretty simular but the blue is completely different and so is the font also in terms of the name, Yes we took inspiration from facebook <strong>but</strong> not the company the object "facebook" was originally something like a "yearbook" - stackexchange. And we just put libre which is free in spanish infront because it sounded better than 'freebook'.</p>
